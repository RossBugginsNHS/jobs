## Why work in KMPT Dev Team?

- membership of NHS Pension Scheme
- flexible working policy
- generous holiday entitlement
- training and development opportunities

## About the KMPT Dev Team
- Implement integration between internal and external platforms
- Develop C# DotNetCore Microservices & Restful APIs, providing access to key data sets and systems
- Manage deployment processes using Kubernetes and Helm Charts
- Help junior members of the team, progressing their skills and knowledge

We develop primarily in C# .NET Core, but are not a "Microsoft only" team. We're currently migrating to Ubuntu based Kubernetes clusters. Our development focus is Microservices deployments and asynchronous RESTful APIs. Our implementations draw from CQRS principles.

The team practice agile methodologies, with rapid bi-weekly sprints allowing us to deliver updates regularly and successfully. We deploy to various environments using gated CI/CD.
